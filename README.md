# Open Source Maternity Dashboard Project
Project to visualise the NHS England Maternity dataset

This is a project completed under the Data Science (Visualisation) Acceleration scheme, over a period of 12 weeks from April - July 2024. More information can be found at [this page](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-science-accelerator-programme/introduction-to-the-data-science-accelerator-programme), however as of July 2024 this program is no longer running. 

As the primary aim of completing a project such as this is to develop the skills and knowledge of the learner in a specific area there will be many ways this could be improved, and so suggestions are welcome. This is an experimental tool to investigate the feasibility of replacing proprietary software currently used to display data, such as PowerBI. [The data is already published online](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-maternity-statistics) and is not sensitive.

The purpose of the project was to build a dashboard to enable users to explore the maternity dashboard in a more visual and user friendly format than the [current dashboard](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/maternity-services-data-set/maternity-services-dashboard). It was build completely using python, and specifically with Plotly-Dash to allow interactive plots.
Users can choose to explore different metrics, at provider and regional level, and explore the data in the form of a map, chart or time series.
